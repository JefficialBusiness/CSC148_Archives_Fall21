In Pennsylvania, an automatic recount is triggered if the final margin is within 0.5 percent of the total votes cast. Right now, Biden is ahead of Trump by 0.1 percentage point, but it makes sense to wait for more votes before making a call, especially when we think there are more than 100000 votes left to count, and Biden s lead is about 6700 votes at this point. If Biden can widen his lead as more votes come in, it will lower the chances of an automatic recount.It is now Trump s turn to try to close a gap in Georgia. We estimate that Trump would need to win only 52 percent of the 24600 potentially outstanding votes in Georgia in order to regain the lead.
